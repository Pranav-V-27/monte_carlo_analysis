# Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Analysis

This is a Python script that uses Monte Carlo simulations to analyze a portfolio of assets. The script downloads historical data for the selected assets using the Yahoo Finance API, then simulates the future performance of the portfolio by randomly generating potential returns based on the historical data.

The simulation can be run with various inputs, including the number of simulations to perform, the number of days to simulate forward, and the weights of each asset in the portfolio. The output of the simulation is a graph showing the potential future returns of the portfolio.

This code uses the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

To use this script, download the code and run the `monte_carlo_main.ipynb` file. Make sure to have the required libraries installed.
